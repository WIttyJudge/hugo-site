      <description>I have been using Arch Linux for about 3 years now and only recently I needed to print and scan documents with my office printer (Canon MF260).
Preconfigured Linux distros like Ubuntu, Mint, Manjaro, etc.. already provided you with some functionality to use your printer/scanner. All you need to do is just log in to your favorite DE, search for &amp;ldquo;printer&amp;rdquo; in the application launcher, click on the &amp;ldquo;Add a printer&amp;rdquo; button and it will magically discover your Wi-Fi wireless or plugged-in printer, install all drivers for that specific printer and&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s ready for use.</description>

      <description>Introduction WireGuard is a lightweight communication protocol that implements encrypted virtual privacy network (VPN).
In my humble opinion, if you are simple user, you should use VPN, because:
It gives you more freedom to access the internet safely from your smartphone or laptop when connected to a doubt network, like any public WiFi. You have an access to websites blocked in your country for some reasons. WireGuard is so awesome. But why?</description>
