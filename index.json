[{"categories":null,"contents":"   Introduction  WireGuard is a lightweight communication protocol that implements encrypted virtual privacy network (VPN).\nIn my humble opinion, if you are simple user, use should use VPN, because:\n It gives you more freedom to access the internet safely from your smartphone or laptop when connected to a doubt network, like any public WiFi. You have an access to websites blocked in your country for some reason.  Here are just a few reasons why WireGuard is so cool:\n It implemented in less then 4,000 lines of code, that means it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to auditing and reviewing the code for security vulnerabilities. It uses modern cryptography (Noise protocol framework, Curve25519, ChaCha20Poly1305, SipHash-2-4, HKDF, etc.). It\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;s an incredibly fast, check out the performance comparison charts done by the WireGuard author, Jason Donenfeld.   Benchmarked alongside IPSec in two modes and OpenVPN. CPUs: Intel Core i7-3820QM and Intel Core i7-5200U. Ethernet Cards: Intel 82579LM and Intel I218LM gigabit Ethernet.  If you\u0026rsquo;re interested to setup WireGuard on your own server, keep reading.\n   Prerequisites  To follow this tutorial, you will need:\n The setup steps are very similar, so you\u0026rsquo;re free to use any linux distro you want, but in this guide I will use Ubuntu 20.04. I would recommend you choosing a server with unlimited traffic or at least 1000 GB. You well need a client machine that you will use to connect to your WireGuard server. In that guide, we well create configs for two clients, android and linux.     Set up steps  Connect to your server.\nssh root@\u0026lt;ip\u0026gt;    Step 1 - Update your system  Update system packages to up-to-date version.\napt update apt upgrade I also prefer to use neovim as my editor.\napt install neovim    Step 2 - Installing WireGuard on server  apt install wireguard    Step 3 - Enable IP forwarding on the server  echo \u0026#34;net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/sysctl.conf Check out is that string was added.\nsysctl -p    Step 4 - Generate server and clients private and public keys  Change directory to /etc/wireguard.\ncd /etc/wireguard Generate public and private server keys.\nwg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey | tee publickey Then, generate keys for our clients. I prefer to first create folder with the nickname or device of client that will use VPN. In this guide, I will create configs for two clients, android and linux.\nmkdir android mkdir linux Then, generate keys inside created folders.\nwg genkey | tee android/privatekey | wg pubkey | tee android/publickey wg genkey | tee linux/privatekey | wg pubkey | tee linux/publickey    Step 5 - Create server config  Create config file and edit it.\ntouch wg0.conf wg0.conf will result in an interface named wg0 therefore you can rename the file if you fancy something different.\nnvim wg0.conf Copy and paste following code to the wg0.conf file.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  [Interface] Address = 10.0.0.1/24 PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE ListenPort = 51820 PrivateKey = \u0026lt;Server Private Key\u0026gt; [Peer] PublicKey = \u0026lt;Android client public key\u0026gt; AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.5/32 [Peer] PublicKey = \u0026lt;Linux client public key\u0026gt; AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.6/32   Take a look at server\u0026rsquo;s PrivateKey and peer\u0026rsquo;s PublicKey sections. It requires to copy and paste keys we generated recently.\n   Step 5 - Start the WireGuard server  Now start the service.\nsystemctl enable wg-quick@wg0 systemctl start wg-quick@wg0 Double check that the WireGuard service is active with the following command. You should see active (running) in the output:\nwg show wg0 interface: wg0 public key: \u0026lt;Public server key here\u0026gt; private key: (hidden) listening port: 51820 peer: \u0026lt;Public adroid client key here\u0026gt; allowed ips: 10.0.0.5/32 peer: \u0026lt;Public linux client key here\u0026gt; allowed ips: 10.0.0.6/32 systemctl status wg-quick@wg0 ‚óè wg-quick@wg0.service - WireGuard via wg-quick(8) for wg0 Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/wg-quick@.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (exited) since Thu 2022-04-14 19:08:04 UTC; 49min ago Docs: man:wg-quick(8) man:wg(8) https://www.wireguard.com/ https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/ https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg-quick.8 https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg.8 Process: 32190 ExecStart=/usr/bin/wg-quick up wg0 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) Main PID: 32190 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) Apr 14 19:08:04 wireguard systemd[1]: Starting WireGuard via wg-quick(8) for wg0...

Step 6 - Create client config (Anroid)  Create file called android.conf and add the following content.\n[Interface] PrivateKey = \u0026lt;Android client private key\u0026gt; Address = 10.0.0.5/24 DNS = 1.1.1.1 [Peer] PublicKey = \u0026lt;Server public key\u0026gt; Endpoint = \u0026lt;SERVER-IP\u0026gt;:51820 AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24 PersistentKeepalive = 20 AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 will allow you to route all traffic though the VPN tunnel.\nNow we need to transfer this config to the smartphone. Of course, you can somehow move this file, but it\u0026rsquo;s more convenient to use a QR-code.\nInstall qrencode.\napt install qrencode Use it\nqrencode -t ansiutf8 \u0026lt; android.conf After that we will see the QR code in terminal. All we have to do is to scan it using WireGuard app on the mobile phone. You can install it in Play Market or F-Droid\n","date":"Apr 15","permalink":"https://example.com/posts/setup-wireguard-vpn/","tags":["vpn","opensource"],"title":"Set up WireGuard on your own Ubuntu 20.04 server"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"Jan 01","permalink":"https://example.com/posts/","tags":null,"title":"Posts"}]
